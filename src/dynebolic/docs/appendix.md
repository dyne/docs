# Appendix II: The Dyne Foundation

*dyne:bolic* is brought to you by the [Dyne Foundation](https://dyne.org). The Dyne Foundation is a *think & do tank*, born as an on-line community in 1999 by uniting artists, activists and hackers of mixed backgrounds. It is also a young research organization working on a growing number of succesful projects for the European Commission. These are its three guiding principles:

 - **Diversity**: We love to mix: methods, disciplines, knowledge,
   culture and languages. We love our Bastard Culture!
 - **Open-source**: Code is our literature: we build software to
   communicate, interact and inspire. Dyne.org is where art, science
   and technology meet open source.
 - **Ecology**: We recycle old technology rather than create needs for
   new one: this is our way to respect the environment and optimize
   resources.

The Dyne Foundation develops and promotes projects focused on free software and free culture, and hosts the development of [a large selection of free software](https://dyne.org/software/). Notably, the Dyne Foundation hosts and supports the development of the [Devuan](https://www.devuan.org/) "init freedom" Linux Distribution, which *dyne:bolic* is based on.

It takes a mandatory -s option   which is the size in megabytes (MiB). Tombs are digged using random   data gathered from a non-blocking source (/dev/urandom). For very   large tombs this may take up too much time and entropy, then it is   possible to use fallocate(1) being aware it does not pre-fill   with random data, decreasing the tomb's security.</p> </li> <li> <p>forge   Creates a new key and prompts the user for a password to protect   its usage using symmetric encryption. This operation uses random data from a   non-blocking source (/dev/urandom) and it may take long only in some cases; to   switch using a blocking source the --use-random flag can be used. The   -g option switches on the use of a GPG key instead of a password   (asymmetric encryption), then the -r option indicates the recipient key;   more recipient GPG ids can be indicated (comma separated). The default cipher   to protect the key is AES256, a custom one can be specified using the -o   option, for a list of supported ciphers use -v. For additional protection   against dictionary attacks on keys, the --kdf option can be used when   forging a key, making sure that the binaries in extras/kdf were compiled   and installed on the system.</p> </li> <li> <p>lock   Initializes and locks an empty tomb (made with dig) using a key   (made with forge), making it ready for usage. After this   operation, the tomb can only be opened in possession of the key and   knowing its password. As in any other command requiring a key, the   option -k should be used to specify a key file; in case of   encryption to GPG recipients the -g flag should be used followed   by -r and the recipient's secret GPG key id.  The -o   option can be used to specify the cipher specification: default is   \"aes-xts-plain64\", old versions of Tomb used \"aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\".   If you are looking for something exotic, also try   \"serpent-xts-plain64\". More options may be found in cryptsetup(8) and   Linux documentation. The --filesystem option can be used to   specify an alternative filesystem used to format the tomb,   in place of the default \"ext4\". This operation requires root   privileges to loopback mount, format the tomb (using LUKS and mkfs),   then set the key in its first LUKS slot.</p> <p>Supported filesystems for --filesystem: * ext3   using operating system defaults * ext4   using operating system defaults * btrfs   for tombs &gt;= 47MB using operating system defaults * btrfsmixedmode   for tombs &gt;=18MB btrfs mixed mode (see mkfs.btrfs(8)) * ext3maxinodes   ext3 with a maximum of inodes (for many small files) * ext4maxinodes   ext4 with a maximum of inodes (for many small files)</p> </li> <li> <p>open   Opens an existing tomb file (first argument) using a key   (-k) which can also be hidden inside a jpeg image (see   bury/exhume) or a long text file   (see_cloak_/uncloak). If a second argument is given it will   indicate the mountpoint where the tomb should be made   accessible, else the tomb is mounted in a directory inside /media (if   not available it uses /run/media/$USER).  The option -o can be   used to pass mount(8) options (default: rw,noatime,nodev). The   -g option is needed when using GPG encryption to recipients.</p> </li> <li> <p>list   List all the tombs found open, including information about the time   they were opened and the hooks that they mounted. If the first   argument is present, then shows only the tomb named that way or   returns an error if it's not found. If the option   --get-mountpoint is used then print a simple list of currently   open tomb mountpoint paths.</p> </li> <li> <p>ps   List all the processes found running inside the tombs that are open,   printing out their PIDs and owners. This is useful to have an overview   of programs that are keeping the tombs busy and would eventually be   killed by the slam command. The lsof(8) utility is used   internally to enumerate processes running in one or all tombs.</p> </li> <li> <p>index   Creates or updates the search indexes of all tombs currently open:   enables use of the search command using simple word patterns on   file names. Indexes are created using mlocate/plocate's updatedb(8) and   swish-e(1) if they are found on the system. Indexes allow one to search   very fast for filenames and contents inside a tomb, they are stored   inside it and are not accessible if the Tomb is closed. To avoid   indexing a specific tomb simply touch a .noindex file in it.</p> </li> <li> <p>search   Takes any string as argument and searches for them through all tombs   currently open and previously indexed using the index command.   The search matches filenames if mlocate/plocate is installed and then also   file contents if swish++ is present on the system, results are listed   on the console.</p> </li> <li> <p>close   Closes a currently open tomb.  If more tombs are open, the first   argument should be used to specify the name of the tomb to be closed,   or all to close all currently open tombs. This command fails if   the tomb is in use by running processes (to force close, see   slam below).</p> </li> <li> <p>slam   Closes a tomb like the command close does, but it doesn't fail   even if the tomb is in use by other application processes: it looks   for and closes each of them (in order: TERM, HUP, KILL). This command may   provoke unsaved data loss, but assists users to face surprise   situations. It requires lsof else it falls back to close.</p> </li> <li> <p>passwd   Changes the password protecting a key file specified using   -k. With keys encrypted for GPG recipients use -g followed   by -r to indicate the new recipient key, or a comma separated   list.. The user will need to know the key's current password, or   possess at least one of the current recipients GPG secret keys,   because the key contents will be decoded and reencoded using the new   passwords or keys. If the key file is broken (missing headers) this   function also attempts its recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p>setkey   Changes the key file that locks a tomb, substituting the old one with   a new one. Both the old and the new key files are needed for this   operation and their passwords or GPG recipient(s) secret keys must be   available. The new key must be specified using the -k option,   the first argument should be the old key and the second and last   argument the tomb file. Use the -g option to unlock the tomb   with a GPG key, the -r to indicate the recipient or a comma   separated list for more than one recipient.</p> </li> <li> <p>resize   Increase the size of a tomb file to the amount specified by the   -s option, which is the new size in megabytes (MiB). Full access   to the tomb using a key (-k) and its password is required. Tombs   can only grow and can never be made smaller. This command makes use of   the cryptsetup(8) resize feature and the resize2fs command: its much   more practical than creating a new tomb and moving everything into   it. There is no data-loss if a failure occurs during resize: the   command can be re-launched and the resize operation will complete.</p> </li> <li> <p>engrave   This command transforms a tomb key into an image that can be printed   on paper and physically stored as backup, i.e. hidden in a book. It   Renders a QRCode of the tomb key, still protected by its password: a   PNG image (extension .qr.png) will be created in the current   directory and can be later printed (fits an A4 or Letter format).  To   recover an engraved key one can use any QRCode reader on a smartphone:   save it into a file and then use that file as a key (-k).</p> </li> <li> <p>bury   Hides a tomb key (-k) inside a jpeg image (first argument)   using steganography: the image will change in a way that cannot   be noticed by human eye and hardly detected by data analysis. This   option is useful to backup tomb keys in unsuspected places; it depends   from the availability of steghide. Use the -g flag and   -r option followed by recipient id to use GPG asymmetric   encryption.</p> </li> <li> <p>exhume   This command recovers from jpeg images the keys that were previously   hidden into them using bury.  Exhume requires a key filename   (-k) and a jpeg image file (first argument) known to be   containing a key. If the right key password is given, the key will be   exhumed. If the password is not known, it is very hard to verify if a   key is buried in any image or not.</p> </li> <li> <p>cloak   Hides a tomb key (-k) inside a long plain-text file (first   argument) using steganography: the text will change in a way   that can hardly be noticed by human eye and hardly detected by data   analysis. This option is useful to backup tomb keys in unsuspected   places; it depends from the availability of cloakify and   consequently python2. This function does not support asymmetric   encryption using the -g flag.</p> </li> <li> <p>uncloak   This command recovers from long plain-text files the keys that were   previously hidden into them using cloak.  Cloak requires a key   filename (-k) and a plain-text file (first argument) known   to be containing a key. If the right key password is given, the key   will be exhumed. If the password is not known, it is quite hard to   verify if a key is buried in a text or not.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"manpage/#options","title":"Options","text":"<ul> <li> <p>-k &lt;keyfile&gt;   For all operations requiring a key, this option specifies the location   of the key file to use.

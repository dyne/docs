# Frequently Asked Questions about CJIT

Here we try to answer the most asked questions.

## What's different between `tcc -run` and CJIT?

The main difference is in usability.

CJIT improves three main UX aspects for now:

1. It works as a single executable file which embeds the TinyCC
   compiler, all its headers and its standard library. This way there
   is no need to install anything system wide, check paths and setup
   build folders.

2. It supports adding multiple files into one execution: can accept
   wildcards to ingest anything that is a C source, a pre-compiled
   object or a shared library. The symbols exported by each file will
   be visible to all during the same execution.

3. It finds automatically common system libraries for each target
   platform, avoiding the need to repeat these settings and look for
   the right paths.

We are happy to further the improve developer experience with CJIT,
and your advice is welcome: [open an issue](https://github.com/dyne/cjit/issues)!

## What's different between `libgccjit` and CJIT?

CJIT is built as an command-line interpreter using the TinyCC backend
for in-memory compilation. In the future it may also offer `libgccjit`
as backend, as long as it will be possible to embed it all inside a
single executable file, which is a core feature of CJIT's vision for
developer experience.

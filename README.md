## Install dependencies

You need to have mkdocs and the material plugin installed:
```
apt-get install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
```

If your system is complaining that mkdocs-material is an externally-managed-environment, you can use `venv` instead:

Create the virtual environment
```
python -m venv path/to/venv
```
Install mkdocs-material to the environment
```
path/to/venv/bin/pip install mkdocs-material
```

Activate the virtual environement
```
source path/to/venv/bin/activate
```


## Create a new project

Go inside the `src/` folder and use `mkdocs new name_of_project`.

Beware the name you chose will also be in the url `https://dyne.org/docs/name_of_project`.

Go inside the freshly created project folder and use mkdocs as usual

üëÅÔ∏è preview using `mkdocs serve` directly in each src/ folder.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è  never do `mkdocs deploy`! But instead...

## Publish changes

Go in the root of this repository and do `make deploy`.

If there are no changes in the src files then an error will be returned and no commit created.

Read carefully the errors returned because some warnings contain useful information.
